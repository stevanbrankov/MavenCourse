- if refactoring has been done, those old compiled artifacts will be there (target folder); they will still be
picked up on your class path -> and weird stuff may happen -> to avoid it, run clean goal

- phases are hooks to run plugins

- example:
- during initialize phase, maven-clean-plugin will run clean goal

   <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-clean-plugin</artifactId>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>auto-clean</id>
                        <phase>initialize</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>clean</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
